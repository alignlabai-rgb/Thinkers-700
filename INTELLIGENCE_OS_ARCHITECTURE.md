# Intelligence OS Architecture: The Blueprint of Human Progress

## 1. Core Mission
The **Thinkers-700** project is not just a database of history; it is an investigation into the **Software of Human Intelligence**. 
Each thinker in this list has provided a critical "Update," "Patch," or "Refactor" to the invisible Operating Systems (OS) that govern how we perceive reality, organize society, and interact with the universe.

## 2. The Canon 14 OS Layers
Human civilization runs on 14 fundamental OS layers. Every detail page must identify which layer(s) the thinker upgraded.

### I. The Foundation Layers (Substrate)
| OS Layer | Function | Core Objective |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **哲学OS (Philosophy)** | The execution environment. | Defining existence, truth, and the limits of reason. |
| **数学OS (Math)** | The logic of quantity and form. | Providing the ultimate language of certainty. |
| **言語OS (Language)** | The communication protocol. | Mapping reality to symbols and shared meaning. |

### II. The Structural Layers (Society)
| OS Layer | Function | Core Objective |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **政治OS (Politics)** | Power management. | Designing the "Trust Architecture" of human groups (The State). |
| **法OS (Law)** | The security & contract rules. | Standardizing conflict resolution and rights management. |
| **社会OS (Social)** | The interaction middleware. | Managing social inequality, gender, and group identity. |
| **経済OS (Economics)** | The value transaction engine. | Optimizing resource allocation and incentives. |

### III. The Knowledge Layers (External)
| OS Layer | Function | Core Objective |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **科学OS (Science)** | The hardware driver. | Understanding the physical laws of the natural world. |
| **技術OS (Technology)** | The human-machine interface. | Extending human capabilities through physical/digital tools. |

### IV. The Human/Internal Layers (Internal)
| OS Layer | Function | Core Objective |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **心理OS (Psychology)** | The user experience (UX). | Analyzing the internal processing of the mind and ego. |
| **倫理OS (Ethics)** | The safety & value protocol. | Defining "The Good" and guiding behavior through values. |
| **教育OS (Education)** | The installation & bootloader. | Perfecting the transmission of intelligence to the next generation. |

### V. The Metaphysical Layers (Cultural)
| OS Layer | Function | Core Objective |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **芸術OS (Art)** | The GUI / Creative Output. | Processing experience through aesthetics and emotion. |
| **宗教OS (Religion)** | The cloud legacy / transcendence. | Connecting humanity to the infinite and the unknowable. |

## 3. Mapping Guidelines (System Design)
To maintain search efficiency and clarity, granular topics should be mapped to the Canon 14:

| Special Topic | Primary OS Layer | Secondary OS Layer |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **人権 (Human Rights)** | 社会OS | 政治OS |
| **生物学 / 物理学** | 科学OS | - |
| **メディア / 通信** | 技術OS | 言語OS |
| **論理学 / 認識論** | 哲学OS | - |
| **フェミニズム** | 社会OS | 倫理OS |
| **環境 / 生態系** | 科学OS | 倫理OS |

## 4. Branding
Every page should treat the thinker's contribution as a **Version Update**.
- **Version 1.0**: Conventional wisdom (旧常識).
- **Version 2.0+**: The thinker's contribution (新パラダイム).
- **Patch Notes**: Section 3 (Kernel) details the specific "Code Rewrite."
